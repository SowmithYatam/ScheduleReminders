[GET] ALL Remainders : http://localhost:8282
[POST] Remainder : http://localhost:8282 @Body -> {userId:"",title:"",message:"",sendTime:"",phoneNumber:"",emailId:""}
[PUT] Remainder: same as above
[DELETE] Remainder : http://localhost:8282?id=""


Once a reminder is created, we put this entry into cache with TTL. Where TTL is diff between current time and send time.
As soon as the entry is expired.A callback to the Message logic will executed.

cache used is Ehcache which is a JCache implementation. And Embedded DB (Derby) is used to store the reminder data.

I have used, cache's TTL to send message on time. But we can also use Timer in java.

Yet to complete:

Testing is not done on the message execution part.
Status will not change even if the message is executed.
Although I have started with creating a UI Component for creating and reading the reminders, I couldnt proceed due to the timeframe
User based login is not implemented.
Would have loved to host this any k8s platform, but couldnt get enough time
